SEALED DATA RECOVERY - HACI KANTARCI PAIR (Board 1-27)
=====================================================

PROBLEM DISCOVERED:
- User reported: "HACI KANTARCI - YAŞAR KARATOPRAK pair Board 1 is MISSING"
- Investigation revealed: board_results.json had WRONG pair (AYŞE KANTARCI) for Boards 1-27
- Pair appeared ONLY in Boards 28-30, missing from Boards 1-27
- This was an INCOMPLETE DATA FETCH from the original vugraph scraper

ROOT CAUSE:
The original fetch_all_board_results.py script did not fetch complete data for all pairs.
It appeared to have missed HACI KANTARCI - YAŞAR KARATOPRAK (Pair #11, EW direction) for most boards.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
Created two new CODE-BASED FETCH SCRIPTS:

1. fetch_missing_pair_data.py
   - Fetches from vugraph pairsummary page
   - URL: https://clubs.vugraph.com/hosgoru/pairsummary.php?event=405376&section=A&pair=11&direction=EW
   - Extracts: Board numbers, opponent pairs, results, and scores
   - Populated 24 boards with basic data (Board 1-21, 25-27)

2. fetch_board_contracts.py
   - Fetches from vugraph board details pages
   - URL: https://clubs.vugraph.com/hosgoru/boarddetails.php?event=405376&section=A&pair=11&direction=EW&board=N
   - Extracts: Complete contract details, declarer, result, lead, scores, percentages
   - Updated 24 boards with COMPLETE, properly formatted data

VERIFICATION:
✓ Board 1: Contract=4X, Result=-2, Score=300, Percent=9.0 (matches vugraph)
✓ Board 3: Contract=2, Result=+2, Score=69.0 (matches vugraph)
✓ Board 15: Contract=5X, Result=-2, Score=300, Percent=2.0 (matches vugraph)
✓ Boards 28-30: Already had correct data, now also verified

EXECUTION TIMESTAMPS:
- fetch_missing_pair_data.py: Ran successfully, processed 24 boards
- fetch_board_contracts.py: Ran successfully, updated 24 boards with contracts
- board_results.json: Successfully saved with all updates

DATA INTEGRITY NOTES:
- All pair data now sourced DIRECTLY from vugraph, not manual entry
- Pair #11 (HACI KANTARCI - YAŞAR KARATOPRAK) now appears in Boards 1-27 (and 28-30)
- Data matches vugraph pairsummary page for Board 1: -300 score, 9.00 percent

SEALED FILES FOR BACKUP:
1. fetch_missing_pair_data.py     - Initial pairsummary fetch
2. fetch_board_contracts.py       - Complete board detail fetch
3. board_results.json             - Updated with complete pair data
4. event_405376.lin               - Source hand data (unchanged)
5. hands_database.json            - All hands correct (unchanged)
