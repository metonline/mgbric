## Troubleshooting

Problem: Status shows error (4xx or 5xx)
Solution:
- Verify .env.webhook has exact secret
- Check Python app is running in cPanel
- Look at error logs in cPanel > Errors section

Problem: Webhook times out
Solution:
- Shared hosting may have execution limits
- Contact hosting provider to increase timeout
- Or use alternative cron method instead

Problem: "Bad address" or connection refused
Solution:
- Check firewall is not blocking
- Verify you're using correct domain (mgbric.info)
- Try test endpoint: https://mgbric.info/hosgoru/health
