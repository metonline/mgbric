# Automatic Tournament Data Fetcher - Quick Reference

## 3 Ways to Automate Data Fetching

### 1️⃣ EASIEST: Guided Setup
```bash
python setup_auto_fetch.py
```
This opens an interactive menu to set up Windows Task Scheduler automatically.

---

### 2️⃣ SIMPLE: Manual Check/Fetch
```bash
# Check for new data (no download)
python auto_fetch_tournaments.py --check

# Actually fetch and update
python auto_fetch_tournaments.py

# See all available dates
python auto_fetch_tournaments.py --list
```

---

### 3️⃣ BACKGROUND: Continuous Scheduler
```bash
# Install schedule package first
pip install schedule

# Run in background (checks daily at noon, every 6 hours)
python background_fetch_scheduler.py

# Or specify custom time (6:00 PM, every 8 hours)
python background_fetch_scheduler.py 18:00 8
```

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `auto_fetch_tournaments.py` | Main automatic fetcher - checks for new dates and fetches them |
| `setup_auto_fetch.py` | Interactive setup wizard for Windows Task Scheduler |
| `background_fetch_scheduler.py` | Background scheduler (alternative to Windows Task Scheduler) |
| `AUTOMATIC_FETCH_README.md` | Complete documentation with troubleshooting |

## What It Does

1. **Scans** Vugraph calendar for all dates with events
2. **Checks** which dates are missing from your database  
3. **Fetches** data for missing dates only
4. **Updates** database with new records
5. **Prevents** duplicates by removing old data first

---

## Example: Set Up Daily Auto-Fetch

**Option A: Windows Task Scheduler (No extra installation)**
```bash
python setup_auto_fetch.py
# Choose option 1, press Enter for default midnight time
```

**Option B: Background Python Scheduler**
```bash
pip install schedule
python background_fetch_tournaments.py 12:00
# Runs at noon every day
```

---

## Current Status

✅ **30 dates** are in your database (Dec 1-31, 2025)
✅ **All available** tournament data has been fetched
✅ **Data is accurate** - both NS and EW sections properly parsed

**Next new data will be automatically fetched** when:
- You set up automatic fetching (above)
- January 2026 dates become available on Vugraph calendar
- Or run manually: `python auto_fetch_tournaments.py`
