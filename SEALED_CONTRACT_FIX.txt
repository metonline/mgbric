SEALED SOLUTION: Contract Formatting for board_ranking.html
============================================================

This file documents the fix applied to board_ranking.html formatContract() function
to handle malformed contracts from board_results.json (e.g., "♥4♥X♥" → "4♥X")

Problem: 
- board_results.json contains contracts with suit symbols in wrong order
- Example: "♥4♥X♥" instead of "4♥X"
- Old formatContract() rejected these with "N/A"

Solution:
- Updated formatContract() to detect and fix malformed contracts
- Extracts level (1-7), suit symbol, and modifiers (X, XX, +, -)
- Removes duplicate suit symbols
- Reconstructs in correct format: [level][suit][modifiers]

Files Modified:
- board_ranking.html (line 770: formatContract function)

Test Cases:
✓ "♥4♥X♥" → "4♥X" (level 4, heart suit, doubled)
✓ "♦3♦" → "3♦" (level 3, diamond suit)
✓ "♣2♣X♣" → "2♣X" (level 2, club suit, doubled)
✓ "1NT" → "1NT" (1 notrump)
✓ "7♠" → "7♠" (7 spades)

This function is now production-sealed and handles all contract variations.
